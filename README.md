# MOCK-SITE 
This site as the only purpose to make me used to write a web-application in react.
What this app will do?
I don't know, maybe a portfolio with a authentication and it will allow people to chat with the admin.
I can even add a route where you can post thoughts and images. I'll need a back-end with nodejs. Or I can learn python? It wouldn't be stupid at all.
So, for concluding my examinations...
*_BACK-END_*
The back-end is coded with python, so I can learn something else and add a language I love in my web-developer journey.
*_FRONT-END_*
The front-end is going to use react, to practice my poor knowldge of this framework. I'll may use tailwind for the style.
